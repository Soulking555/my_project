# üöÄ Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created using **Create React App** ‚Äî a tool that helps you quickly set up and develop React applications with minimal configuration.

---

## üì¶ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è `npm start`
Runs the app in **development mode**.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- The app automatically reloads when you make edits.
- You‚Äôll see lint and error messages in the console.

---

### üß™ `npm test`
Starts the test runner in **interactive watch mode**.  
See the official documentation for details on running and managing tests.

---

### üèóÔ∏è `npm run build`
Builds the app for **production** inside the `build` folder.

- The code is minified and optimized for best performance.
- File names include unique hashes for caching.
- After building, your app is ready for **deployment**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è `npm run eject`
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This is a one-way operation.

Running this command removes the single build dependency and copies all configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project.  
Once you eject, you‚Äôll have full control over the configuration ‚Äî but you **can‚Äôt go back** easily.

For most users, the default setup is sufficient and **ejecting isn‚Äôt necessary**.
